**Bio**

Mario Klingemann, known as Quasimondo, is a German computational artist and one of the most influential pioneers in AI-generated art. Often called "The Godfather of AI Art," he began experimenting with neural networks for creative purposes as early as 2013, years before AI art became mainstream. His groundbreaking work has fundamentally shaped how we understand the intersection of artificial intelligence and human creativity, establishing many of the foundational techniques and philosophical frameworks that define the field today.
