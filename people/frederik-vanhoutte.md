**Role**

Computational designer & architect, creator of HE_Mesh library

**Bio**

Frederik Vanhoutte, known as wblut, is a Belgian computational designer and architect who bridges the gap between architecture, design, and creative coding. He's the creator of the HE_Mesh library for Processing, which has become an essential tool for 3D mesh manipulation in creative coding. His work explores parametric design and computational geometry.
